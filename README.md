# Sales E-Commerce Performance

E-Commerce also known as electronic commerce is the buying and selling of goods or services using internet. the payments is usually made by money transfer so the product can be processed.

In this case, I tried to make a dashboard abut sales e-commerce transaction in UK. I got the data from kaggle.com. I used Python to split data that cancel the transaction and get discount into different sheet. I also added some column that determine total price and group of hour transaction. For a visualization, I used tableau public to make it interactive. Here is the look of the dashboard
